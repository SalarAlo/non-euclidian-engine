### Barebones • Correct • Clear • Controlled • Fast

</div>

## 🧭 Overview

**Origo** is a minimalistic 3D engine written entirely in **C++** and **GLSL**,  
built from the ground up for **Linux** — no compromises, no cross-platform clutter.

> _“Everything should be as simple as possible, but no simpler.”_

---

## ⚙️ Features

- 🧱 **Written in C++20** (or newer)  
- 🎨 **GLSL shaders** for complete GPU-side control  
- 🐧 **Linux-only** — native windowing, input, and rendering  
- 🧩 **Modular CMake build system**  
- 🧠 **Focus on correctness, clarity, and performance**

## 🧰 Requirements

| Requirement | Notes |
|--------------|-------|
| **Linux** | Optimized and tested on **Fedora** |
| **C++ Compiler** | Must support **C++20** or newer |
| **OpenGL** | Proper driver support required |
| **CMake** | For building the project |
| **(Optional)** | External libraries (e.g. `stb_image`, `GLM`, etc.) |

---

## 📁 Project Layout

| Path | Description |
|------|--------------|
| `origo/` | Engine core code |
| `game/` | Sample/demo project |
| `resources/` | Shaders, textures, and models |
| `vendor/` | Third-party libraries |
| `CMakeLists.txt` | Root build script |
| `pch.*` | Precompiled headers |
| `overview.sh` | Helper script |

---

## ⚠️ Status

> **Under active development.**  
> Expect breakage, instability, and change.  
> Origo is a living system — correctness and control take priority over stability.
